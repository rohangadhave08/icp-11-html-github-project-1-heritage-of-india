    <p><b>Adi Shankaracharya</b> (8th century CE) was a profound Hindu philosopher and theologian who revitalized <b>Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism)</b>. He emphasized that the <b>individual soul (Atman) is identical to the ultimate reality (Brahman)</b>, and that liberation (Moksha) can be attained through knowledge (Jnana). His commentaries on the <b>Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Brahma Sutras</b> became foundational texts in Hindu philosophy. He also established <b>four monastic centers (mathas) across India</b> to preserve Vedic traditions and unify Hinduism against rising ritualism and sectarianism.</p>

    <p><b>Gautama Buddha</b> (563–483 BCE) was a spiritual teacher and the founder of <b>Buddhism</b>. Born as <b>Prince Siddhartha</b> in Lumbini (modern-day Nepal), he renounced his royal life in search of enlightenment. After intense meditation under the <b>Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya</b>, he attained <b>nirvana (enlightenment)</b> and preached the <b>Four Noble Truths</b> and the <b>Eightfold Path</b> as the way to end suffering (Dukkha). His teachings rejected <b>ritualism and caste divisions</b>, emphasizing <b>compassion, meditation, and self-discipline</b> as the keys to liberation.</p>

    <h3>Key Teachings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Four Noble Truths:</b> Life involves suffering (Dukkha), which is caused by desire; liberation is possible through the Eightfold Path.</li>
        <li><b>Eightfold Path:</b> Right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration.</li>
        <li><b>Middle Way:</b> A balanced path between indulgence and severe asceticism.</li>
        <li><b>Ahimsa (Non-violence):</b> Compassion and non-harming are fundamental virtues.</li>
