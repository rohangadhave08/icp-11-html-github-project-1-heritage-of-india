      <h2>Philosophy and Literature</h2>
      <p>
          <em>Philosophy and literature in India are deeply intertwined, shaped by the country's diverse cultural, religious, 
          and intellectual traditions. Indian philosophy has a long history, with roots going back to the Vedic period (1500â€“500 BCE). 
          The six classical schools of Indian philosophy, including Vedanta, Nyaya, Yoga, and Samkhya, offer varied perspectives 
          on the nature of reality, the self, and the ultimate purpose of life. These philosophies also emphasized concepts like karma, 
          dharma, and moksha. Indian literature, which has existed for thousands of years, spans multiple languages and regions. 
          Ancient literature includes the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana, which not only tell stories of heroism and morality 
          but also offer profound philosophical teachings.</em>
